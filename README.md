this is the git repo for the website running at [v-vv-vv.tech](http://v-vv-vv.tech)

all the content on the website right now is some bean-themed video games:

- [x] [bean jump](http://v-vv-vv.tech/beanjump): a papi trampoline clone, programmed without html5 or flash so very laggy
- [x] [bean tower defense](http://v-vv-vv.tech/beantd): still in development, a basic tower defense game that *is* programmed in html5

bean games i want to add:

 - [ ] bean roguelike
 - [ ] bean runner
 - [ ] bean tycoon
 - [ ] super bean boy
 - [ ] bean shopping cart hero
 - [ ] flappy bean

all code is written by ben lepsch
